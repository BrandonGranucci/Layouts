    Float & Clear Layout
</h1>
<h2>
    This site will display the use of flexbox which is an organization tool to sort elements inside of containers.
</h2>
<h3>
    Below you can see how three boxes are displayed without the use of flexbox.
</h3>
<div class = "container-1">
    <div class="box-1">
        <h3>Box One</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-2">
        <h3>Box Two</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-3">
        <h3>Box Three</h3>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<h3>
    Next you'll see what happens when flex is used on the div that encompasses every box. They will all group with each other on the same line.
</h3>
<br>
<div class = "container-2">
    <div class="box-1">
        <h3>Box One</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-2">
        <h3>Box Two</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-3">
        <h3>Box Three</h3>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<h3>
    You could change each container's rank or size by setting their flex to varying numbers (ex: flex:1). The closer to one, the smaller
    the element <br> compared to other elements. If each element has the same flex number, there is no variation between them.<br>
    Below you will see the appearance of boxes having flex 1, 2, and 3.
</h3>
<div class = "container-2">
    <div class="box-1-2">
        <h3>Box One</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-2-2">
        <h3>Box Two</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-3-2">
        <h3>Box Three</h3>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<h3>
    You could change the order of an element in its container with order: (number). This allows you to not need to restructure your HTML elements. <br>
    The boxes in my HTML code are in the order of box 1, then 2, then 3 but by using the order property <br> I can have them in a different order.
</h3>
<div class = "container-2">
    <div class="box-1-3">
        <h3>Box One</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-2-3">
        <h3>Box Two</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-3-3">
        <h3>Box Three</h3>
    </div>
</div>
<h3>
    Have you noticed that each box is equal in height? If there were to be more content in one box then another you could remove the <br>
    white space that the border includes in the container. Below you will see a center align for items.
</h3>
<div class = "container-3">
    <div class="box-1">
        <h3>Box One</h3>
        <p>
            This box has much more content than the other boxes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box-2">
        <h3>Box Two</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-3">
        <h3>Box Three</h3>
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent vel congue eros.
            Aenean neque erat, consectetur sit amet ex vitae, congue bibendum nunc. Cras nibh urna, tincidunt sed leo id, tincidunt posuere magna.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3>
    You could also align container items at the top with align-items:flex-start or at the bottom with align-items:flex-end. <br> <br>
</h3>
<h3>
    If you want there to be space/margins between the items in your flex box, you need to use justify-content:space-between on your entire container. Also, <br>
    this would mean your boxes would have to be certain sizes, which can be set with width:(number)%.
</h3>
<div class = "container-4">
    <div class="box-1-4">
        <h3>Box One</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-2-4">
        <h3>Box Two</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-3-4">
        <h3>Box Three</h3>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<h3>
    Considering that these columns are too large to be displayed on smaller screens like with phones, you may want to only allow these columns to occur with the
    @media property. <br> If you set a certain min-width:(# of pixels)px inside the @media function, and wrap it around the column in the css file, <br>
    the columns won't be created. You could see the columns vanish if you shrink the browser.
</h3>
<br>
<h3>
    If you want to ensure that your elements wrap around to the next line, use the flex-wrap:wrap property inside of your container.

<div class = "container-5">
    <div class="box-1-4">
        <h3>Box One</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-1-4">
        <h3>Box Two</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-1-4">
        <h3>Box Three</h3>

    <div class="box-1-4">
        <h3>Box Four</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="box-1-4">
        <h3>Box Five</h3>

    <div class="box-1-4">
        <h3>Box Six</h3>

    <div class="box-1-4">
